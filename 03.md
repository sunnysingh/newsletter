# Should you be perfect? ‚ú®

In my [previous newsletter issue](https://buttondown.email/sunnysingh/archive/ecef9922-e621-429c-bb1a-eb8e6c815a6c), I talked a lot about personal branding and the importance of being consistent. But I'm sure that some of you might be thinking...

> Consistency is great and all Sunny, but I have high expectations. I value quality over quantity.

I believe that those expectations are important, but not in the short term. It takes time to reach perfection, but in that process you will have to get better at your craft. How do you do that? By shipping more.

## Just ship it

*(you know, like [Nike's slogan](https://youtu.be/Fq2CvmgoO7I))*

The indie maker community places a lot of importance on shipping, meaning to release whatever you're working on to the public as quickly as possible. This is great advice for getting real world validation of your idea and have something to show for.

To actually ship something is harder, especially for those that deem perfection with high regard. But take this comic that I recently saw on Gary Vaynerchuk's Instagram:

Perfection is an excuse that keeps you away from shipping. There's no shame in polishing a release to ensure that users don't experience software bugs or simple grammar mistakes, but after a certain point, you just have to put it out there.

I've learned a lot from failed projects. Imagine though if I took a lot longer to release them or even worse, not have released at all. There would be no real world feedback, experience, and lessons that I could use on future projects.

## New Podcast: Building a brand with content

I recorded a new episode for my podcast this week in continuation of the whole branding theme. In particular, I talk about how you *should* be marketing on social media with **native content**, and not just posting links to your preferred platform.

## New Article: JavaScript Quick Tip - Import from folder

I wrote a quick tip for cleaning up your JavaScript import statements using something I call the index re-export pattern. My hope is to write more articles like this that provide "quick wins" for large project maintenance.

## Tools I discovered

I routinely come across cool and useful tools, so here are my favorites from the week:

- [Gluegun](https://infinitered.github.io/gluegun) - A delightful toolkit for building Node-powered CLIs.
- [Netlify menubar](https://github.com/stefanjudis/netlify-menubar) - See, monitor and controls builds from within your top menubar.
- [react-rewards](https://github.com/thedevelobear/react-rewards) - Add microinteractions to your app and reward users with the rain of confettis, flying emoji or memphis design particles in seconds.

## ü§ó How is your Sunday?

I hope that this newsletter makes your Sunday, or whatever day you're reading it on, better. Instead of just listing links to things that I did in the week, I like to write more of a story that pulls everything in together.

I'd love to hear from you though, with some honest feedback! Looking forward, and have a good rest of the week ‚úåÔ∏è
