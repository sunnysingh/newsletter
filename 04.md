# How do I stay productive? 🧐

A frequent comment I get is that I do a lot ‒ podcasts, videos, articles, and side projects. How do I manage it all?

Well, I create tasks for myself that are easy to accomplish:

[![Photo of me pointing to a whiteboard with three completed tasks: Use blue marker, Use pink marker, Write on board.](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/bc45c65d-d392-48a1-aa4c-498e5aa33c5d.jpg)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrBwbLBgnhV/)

🙄 On a serious note, I do try to stay organized throughout the week to ensure that I create enough content consistently every single week. Here is what that schedule looks like:

## Monday

- Plan notes for new podcast episode.
- Get caught up with work.

## Tuesday

- Record new podcast episode.
- Edit podcast.
- Publish podcast to Anchor and YouTube.

## Wednesday

- Share podcast to social media.
- Side project coding.

## Thursday

- Begin writing new article.
- Continue side project coding.

## Friday

- Finish writing article.
- Save cross-posted drafts on DEV and Medium.

## Saturday

- Publish article and share on social media.
- **Try to relax**.

## Sunday

- Write and publish newsletter.
- Release side project bugfixes, features, etc.
- Plan and prepare for the upcoming week.

I make heavy use of [Trello](https://trello.com/) to keep my tasks and notes in one place, with due dates to serve as reminders.

A lot of this ties in to the conversation that I had with [Tzelon Machluf](https://twitter.com/TzelonMachluf) on managing productivity. We both agree that sometimes the day job gets in the way of that, and that is where having that M-F schedule helps.

I also asked Tzelon how he manages it himself. Here's his response:

> I have a few tasks (about 5) for each day. This works for me better as I'm not overwhelmed and allows me to focus only on the important things.
> 
> So at the end of each day I write ~5 tasks for the next day. 🙂

Sounds like an effective plan to me! I try to do this as well, hence my whiteboard.

Keep in mind that it is also **extremely important to take breaks when you feel like you need it**. In honor of that, I decided not to do a podcast episode this week as I became more overloaded with other work. Having this upcoming Monday off will definitely help to get me back on track though.

## What I did this week

I published a new article today titled [The benefits and origins of Server Side Rendering](https://sunnysingh.io/blog/server-side-rendering). A good read if you've ever been confused on this topic.

I also participated in #DevDiscuss, a hashtag-based discussion on Twitter hosted by the DEV community. This week's topic was debugging, and a lot of people seemed to have resonated with [my tweet about the rubber duck debugging technique](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1085360592024731649):

That has been my week. A bit less content than usual but I'm still trying to stay consistent. If I am able to form that habit now, then the rest of the year will go by smoother. I would love to hear from you regarding productivity, either positive or negative. See you next Sunday!
