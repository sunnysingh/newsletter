# Who should you write code for? ü§î

What is code? By definition, it's a set of instructions for a machine to interpret.

As a developer, I don't agree with that definition. I don't write code for machines, **I write code for people**.

That has been the focus of my content this week. I started off with [my response](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1090435645481340929) to this week's #DevDiscuss topic of common fallacies in the software industry:

[![View tweet thread: Common fallacy: The most important part of software development is the code. What's more important is how your code helps people. Is your app solving problems? Does it bring value to others?](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/a0977151-331f-4c11-8f85-154c1c420f58.png)](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1090435645481340929)

One group of people that I write code for is **end users** ‚Äî anyone that is using the actual product. My code may look organized and work as intended, but if the person actually using the product doesn't have a positive user experience then what's the point?

The second group is for **other developers** ‚Äî anyone that may be interacting with the actual code that I write. My code needs to be readable for anyone else to be able to help the end user.

## How do you write readable code?

I published an article recently that answers this question. It provides helpful suggestions that you can apply to your code right now üëá

üìù [Read "Writing code for your future self"](https://sunny.link/readablecode)

If you're curious about the title, it's because I don't believe that clean code is just for team projects. Even as a solo developer, you can come back to your own code a year later and be struggling to understand what is going on.

Friendly reminder: I also publish on [DEV](https://dev.to/sunnysingh) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@sunnysinghio) if you'd like to follow there.
