# Soft skills are hard, but they don't have to be 💬

Coding doesn't matter as much as developers make it seem.

Sure, it's a skill that allows apps to get built, but there are so many other skills related to successfully doing that.

If you've ever had to interview for a job, work with other teams, share your project ideas, or just ever interact with other people then you may reconsider how important a soft skill like communication can be.

You want to be able to convince and negotiate with others. It doesn't matter whether you're right because if other people don't understand you, then they'll think you're wrong.

These are all things that I've realized over the years of launching side projects and working with other developers and teams.

I recorded a new [Sunny Commutes](https://sunnycommutes.fm/) podcast episode this week about communication skills, and how you can improve them. **Listen here** 👇

📝 I'm currently working on a React article and will likely have more content on React coming out this upcoming week. A lot of people enjoyed the [Writing code for your future self](https://sunnysingh.io/blog/readable-code) article so I hope to write more pieces like that as well.

Okay, see you next Sunday! 👋
