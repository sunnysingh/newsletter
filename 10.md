# Forging my own path 🔨

🎂 **My birthday is tomorrow**: March 18, 2019. I will be turning 26, which makes me consider a few life milestones.

- 💼 Worked **2 years** at my current job.
- 🎓 Graduated college **3 years** ago.
- 😧 My 30th birthday will be in **4 years**.

I know I know. Those are low numbers and I'm still young.

But I find it important to set macro goals and accommodate changes at these milestones when things don't turn out as expected.

By this age I was hoping to have followed the same path as Gates and Zuckerberg.

I've however realized that I am not following the path of those that I look up to. I am forging my own path for which I cannot determine an outcome yet.

Good thing is that there is still a level of control; I can continue to build projects, craft content, and form relationships that matter.

When opportunity comes about—be it 4 years or 40 years from now—I will be prepared to take advantage of it.

No matter what happens though, what I aim to do will never change. I will keep wanting to provide value to people using the skills that I've acquired. I want to learn from those above me and set a better standard for those below.
