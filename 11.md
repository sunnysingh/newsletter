# Declarative all the things! ðŸ¥³

![Declarative all the things meme](https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/6a078d5a-a6de-466a-bb97-ae30bb7ef57e.png)

I'm basically the hype person from that "all the things!" meme when it comes to declarative programming, but that recently got me thinking in how common the declarative/imperative terminology actually is among both junior and senior level developers.

Luckily, I got a few good albeit mixed responses to this question on Twitter.

For the most part, it depends on whether you self learned programming, in which case these terms may not be so common. However, Lasha points out that it's not even common among those who have computer science degrees.

Personally, this is terminology that I started using a ton once I learned about it, but it's definitely a form of jargon even to those within the industry. I initially came across the word "declarative" on React's website which they still use today:

> Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
> â€” [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)

If it's complex jargon though, should we stop using it?

## But wait, what is declarative anyway?

To write in a **declarative** style, your code should explain **what** you want to happen.

Let's use React as an example. I want a button to change text when it's clicked, so I'd write:

```html
<button
  onClick={() => setClicked(true)}
>
  {isClicked ? 'Clicked!' : 'Click'}
</button>
```

Even if you're not familiar with React, the code is easy to follow due to its declarative nature.

You could do the same in an **imperative** style, but then your code would explain **how** you'd want it to happen.

This means that you'd use the DOM to select elements and update manually. Something like this:

```js
document.querySelector('#myButton')
  .addEventListener('click', event => {
    event.target.innerHTML = 'Clicked!';
  });
```

Compared to the declarative example, the imperative one is doing a lot of manual work in selecting elements and updating them.

Let's see another example with something a bit more familiar: loops.

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const filtered = [];

for (
  let index = 0;
  index < letters.length;
  index++
) {
  const letter = letters[index];
  if (letter !== 'c') {
    filtered.push(letter);
  }
}

console.log(filtered); // a, b
```

I looped through the `letters` array and created a new `filtered` array without the letter "c". Do you see something wrong with this? It's actually an **imperative** style, which is something that you want to avoid especially with the amount of code for a simple task.

Let's see a **declarative** example:

```js
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

const filtered = letters.filter(
  letter => letter !== 'c'
);

console.log(filtered); // a, b
```

Woah, what happened? Declarative happened. Manually looping over an array just to filter a value out is too much of **how**. Instead, you want to describe **what** you want, which is exactly what the [Array.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method allows you to do.

Hopefully at this point, you understand not only the differences between declarative and imperative styles, but also the benefits that declarative code can provide.

## Talk declarative to me

Jargon, despite its negative connotations, is a quite useful communication tool. When I'm reviewing someone else's code, it's much easier to suggest they make it more declarative than to provide specific explanations and examples. It essentially can save a lot of time in discussing code when everyone are familiar with the imperative and declarative patterns and terminology.

The unfortunate realization that I've had is that these terms are not quite popular, making it confusing jargon rather than useful jargon.

The solution? I would say more usage of these terms to introduce it into common programming vocabulary, as well as articles and tutorials on how code can be written in both imperative and declarative ways.

I will be reposting this newsletter as an article on [my website](https://sunnysingh.io/blog) later which I hope can help with this, but perhaps I'm completely wrong and we should avoid these terms altogether. Do you agree or disagree? Let me know with a reply to this email or to [the original tweet](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1105630128669949952).

## ðŸ“… Past and upcoming updates

My birthday was this past Monday, which means I'm now an extremely old man. And by old man, I mean I'm 26 ðŸ˜…

I shared a life milestone newsletter last week about [forging my own path](https://sunny.link/news10) which I think is useful advice for anyone.

[Bucket lists for developers](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1109263737435893760) is a new project idea that I'm thinking of working on, and have a poll open for the next 5 days to see if it'd be something that people would use. I will continue to share progress on this project.

Hopefully this upcoming week you'll see a new podcast episode from me on the topic of "Providing good developer UX". If you haven't yet, please check out and subscribe to the [Sunny Commutes](https://sunnycommutes.fm/) podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, and any other podcast listening app.

That's enough from me today, so enjoy the week and I'll see you next Sunday ðŸ‘‹
