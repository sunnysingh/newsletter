# Providing value

In life and especially business, everything is about providing value.

We block and ignore advertisements, commercials, and marketing ploys because they are annoying. To put more specifically, most of the products they're selling don't provide us with any value.

That is why there is a lot to learn not from companies, but from brands. When a product is useful **and** creates confidence in your expectations of the company, then a special connection is formed. This connection converts a company into a brand. Suddenly, you're buying products not because they immediately provide you value, but because you believe in the brand and in the value that they have provided you before.

So if you can provide value, then you can build trust, which then allows you to form business.

## How can you provide value?

Don't expect anything out of anyone. If providing value builds trust, then I suggest figuring out what sort of value you can provide.

For myself, I try to provide value through my newsletter, articles, and podcasts. I share across different platforms so that anyone is able to access my content. It's not always about content creation either â€” if anyone is looking for advice or feedback then I try to give my most honest and constructive thoughts.

Small things compound into meaningful connections, which means that you should listen to hear what problems people are actually having. Perhaps then can all aspects of business become more tailored for real people and provide value to real problems.
