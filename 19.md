# ES6 made me love JavaScript üòç

I consider myself a full stack JavaScript developer, but that wasn't always the case. PHP used to be my backend programming language of choice and when paired with the Laravel framework, it was an absolute joy to be able to release web apps so quickly.

So, what exactly changed? Why am I all in on JavaScript despite all the time I put in to learning PHP? Well, I never actually felt like a seasoned PHP developer because my concentration was constantly split between frontend (JavaScript) and backend (PHP) code. This is an issue I refer to as context switching -- shifting your thinking back and forth thus reducing how productive you are on each task.

Node.js, the technology that allows you to write JavaScript on the backend, was released during a time when I felt like JavaScript was not that elegant of a language. Simple tasks felt so primitive, and it was still just something that I'd sprinkle on top of my already working web app.

ES6, a new spec for JavaScript features in 2015, completely changed that thinking for me. This was the starting point for so much amazingness that we can utilize now to make our JavaScript code more powerful and descriptive. Googling how to write multiline strings again? Just use a template literal. Extending objects/arrays and grabbing a few props? Spread and destructuring to the rescue. Pesky issues due to scoping? Not with const, let, and arrow functions. Oh and don't get me started on how awesome Promises and async/await are.

## The switch to JavaScript

It was quite an obvious moment for me. I opened up my PHP project in my editor, started writing JavaScript syntax, and was confused by the error messages. A facepalm later, I decided it was time to switch.

Keep in mind that I did not say anything bad about PHP. I still follow the Laravel community and respect many people in it that are building awesome things. The point that I want to get across is to not take the sunk cost of the investment you put in to learning something to prevent you from taking leaps. It made a lot of sense for me in terms of the context switching, and where I see the JavaScript language going in the future.

Hopefully I'll write more about this topic in the future, or I'll extend upon this when I publish it [to my blog](https://sunnysingh.io/blog). Help me out by giving me your thoughts on this subject by replying or [tweeting](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio).
