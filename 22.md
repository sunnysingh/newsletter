# A live podcast you say? ðŸŽ™

My friend Sergio Mattei, who you've seen me feature on my [Annoyance as a marketing strategy](https://sunnycommutes.fm/episodes/71-annoyance-as-a-marketing-strategy-KYDydz) episode, has invited me on his own show.

It's called [The Shipcast](https://shipcast.live/), and it works a little differently from my own podcast. Entirely interview based, Sergio records while streaming live on Twitch which opens up the ability for instant audience interaction. Not only can watchers ask questions, but also add insights or funny remarks to what is being talked about.

I'm also quite honored to be on the very second episode of The Shipcast, right after Ethan who won first place and \$1k from a 24-hour startup challenge and who also built [KanbanMail](https://kanbanmail.app/).
