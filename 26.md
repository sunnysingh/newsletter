# Being a 10x person

The Twitter world was at peace. Software engineers were happily [deploying code to production on a Friday](https://twitter.com/sunnysinghio/status/1149655528743657474) and sharing their weekend plans. That all changed with [this tweet](https://twitter.com/skirani/status/1149302828420067328) where Shekhar listed the following traits that a rare breed of "10x engineers" posess:

1. They hate meetings.
2. They are irregular about their times in the office.
3. Their wallpapers are black.
4. They know every single line of deployed code.
5. They are full stack engineers, but rarely do UI.
6. They can complete features in a few caffeinated hours.
7. They rarely refer to documentation.
8. They are always learning new frameworks.
9. They are poor mentors and interviewers.
10. They don't write hacks, they have an exact mental model of the code.

He said that these are the types of engineers that founders should be hiring because they will take your startup to success.

He is **10x wrong**.

Engineers are people, and in any company engineers will have to deal with other people. Engineers that don't respect other people's time, that do not care to share their knowledge with others, that don't care for hiring new engineers and helping them grow, and that just overall have terrible communication skills are not the people that you want working with you or even for you.

If you've been following my content for a while, then you know that I care about:

1. Being able to communicate effectively with other people (including non-engineers).
2. Learning the fundamentals, not just the hottest frameworks on the market.
3. Writing non-clever code and making it simple for anyone to understand.
4. Never belittling other programming languages or forms of development.
5. Realizing that no one really knows anything (myself included).

At the end of the day, it's really not about the code. If you are an extremely good engineer but a terrible person, I would not want to work with you, and additionally I would definitely value someone's soft skills (e.g. communication) and willingness to learn above all else.
