# 🌅A bright update

It's been four months since the last newsletter. To jog your memory, I used to send emails out every Sunday with a draft of a future article for my blog, valuable resources I find on the web, and updates on my life and projects.

Long story short, the **sunny newsletter is back** 🎉

## Life updates

In the past few months, I...

- 💼 Left Bank of America to work at [Nomad Health](https://nomadhealth.com/).
- 🏠 Moved from Gastonia to live in Uptown Charlotte.
- 🌍 Traveled to Tanzania, Chicago, Boston, and NY.
- ❤️ Started a relationship.

Highly suggest that you look through [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sunnysingh.io/) posts and stories for visuals.

## Project updates

Not many. I mean, I've maintained [IronMic](https://ironmic.fm/) by fixing critical bugs and implementing a few features, but the V2 update is long overdue.

Even [sunnysingh.io](https://sunnysingh.io/) has been on pause. The last podcast episode was back in July when I [interviewed Erik Rasmussen](https://sunnycommutes.fm/episodes/74-building-open-source-with-erik-rasmussen-K6qlEz), and I haven't created other content for a while.

However, I've been getting back into writing and even recording video. Here's a few **recent creations**:

- 📝 Collaborated with The Product Angle to share how to [Communicate with engineering teams effectively](https://theproductangle.com/communicate-with-engineering-teams-effectively/).
- 📝 Shared a few tips on how to [Simplify JavaScript Promises](https://sunnysingh.io/blog/javascript-promise).
- 📺 Answered the question [What is JAMstack?](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6TYafgA7mx/) and shared related resources that I use to build apps.

## Balance in 2020

Typically, I put a lot of effort into my side projects. This has become an unhealthy balance between my life and work as I mentioned in last year's [looking back on 2018 article](https://sunnysingh.io/blog/looking-back-on-2018).

Expect a new article this year recapping the year and my goals in more detail, but in short I want to create a healthy integration between all the things that I do.

In general, I want to get back on track towards my goal of building a reputable personal brand. As I get back into podcasting again, I will also want to develop improvements to [IronMic](https://ironmic.fm/).

Accomplishing this needs a content plan and schedule. Each piece of content should flow into another, similarly following [Gary Vee's Content Strategy](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/the-garyvee-content-strategy-how-to-grow-and-distribute-your-brands-social-media-content/). I will share my process and tooling with how I manage that, but for now I want to welcome you back to the newsletter!

Have a happy rest of 2019 🎆
