# üìù Origins and ventures of my writing

The earliest that I remember writing creatively is the age of 10, but I published an actual blog around the age of 15. It was a small entertainment website and I covered various topics from current events to movie reviews. At the time, I was a huge fan of [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/) and was essentially trying to replicate their diverse web presence.

Looking through archives, I was able to find this old photo of my computer setup with that same website opened on it:

With the various projects that I continued to pursue, I always tagged along a blog. In 2012, I ran a web development agency with two friends during college, and I enjoyed contributing to our blog centered around more software development focused topics. It seems unnecessary, but it was my early experimentations with content marketing (more eyes on the blog, meant more people aware of the agency as a brand).

My newest writing ventures are my personal website and newsletter. These are part of my personal brand which makes them stand out from my previous projects in that I will likely never shut down my brand as a whole. You might also notice that my setup has changed quite dramatically since my initial start:

 Writing has always been a part of what I do, and perhaps the reason for that is that I genuinely enjoy it. Similar to code, I can try to optimize how my thoughts are expressed in a creative way.

## What is your story?

If you have your own writing origins story, I'd love to hear it! More importantly, I'd love for you to start your own blog to share that story on. I revamped my site for 2019 and [wrote about the process and tech stack](https://sunnysingh.io/blog/revamping-personal-site-gatsby), but expect more resources around writing in the future.
